# MakeVimGreatAgain
This script automates the configuration of VIM and tmux. 
It is tested on Linux (Debian) and MacOsX and seems to work because it uses no system inherent functions
but only git to get the initial Vundle Paket Manager. 
It requires an set-up installation of VIM and tmux. 
It enables nifty little features in vim like folding, colors, the NERDTree, etc. 

Run it by copying it on your computer and do "sh MakeMimGreatAgain.sh", as far as I can tell do NO sudo!
